/*function list(req, res, next) {
    const { movieId } = req.params
    res.json({ data: theaters.filter(movieId? theater => theater.)})
}

Some version of the above code (incomplete) needs to be here,
I think, because I think I need to do a nested router on my 
movies.router for /movies/:movieId/theaters

I need: 
- a list() for /movies/:movieId/theaters
- maybe a separate list() just for theaters? Look at theaters
instructions.
